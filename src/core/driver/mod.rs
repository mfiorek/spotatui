//! The frontend-neutral scheduler ("the driver"): everything the app must do
//! on a timer, extracted from the terminal event loop so any frontend can run
//! playback correctly by calling [`Driver::tick`] at its tick rate.
//!
//! One tick advances playback state (`App::update_on_tick` plus the debounced
//! seek/volume/state flushes), refreshes the OAuth token, syncs OS presence
//! (Discord, MPRIS, window title), detects track changes (lyrics + cover
//! art), counts plays for the global song counter, auto-advances the native
//! queue and the decoded sources, persists the non-Spotify session, and feeds
//! the audio visualizer.
//!
//! What stays with the frontend, injected through [`TickEnv`] or kept at the
//! call site: the visualizer bar count (a function of frontend geometry), the
//! terminal image-protocol probe behind `TickEnv::cover_art_full_image_support`,
//! and the macOS `NSRunLoop` pump (the frontend owns the main thread).
//!
//! A frontend that stops ticking is a bug this module makes loud:
//! `App::playback_position_ms` reports stale once no tick has run for two
//! seconds, instead of leaving a silently frozen playbar.
