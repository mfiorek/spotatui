//! The first-launch interaction surface.
//!
//! Core and infra never talk to the console: every interactive first-run flow
//! (the source picker, Spotify client setup, OAuth URL display, the manual
//! redirect paste, source credential prompts) goes through this trait so the
//! frontend decides how to present it. The terminal frontend's
//! `ConsoleOnboarding` (`tui/onboarding.rs`) reproduces the historical stdout
//! byte for byte; a windowed frontend can implement the same surface with
//! dialogs instead.
//!
//! The retry loops, validation, and persistence stay with the callers - this
//! trait is only the presentation boundary.
