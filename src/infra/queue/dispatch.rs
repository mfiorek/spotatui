//! Native queue playback routing.
//!
//! [`route_queue_event`] is wired **first** in the runtime IoEvent pump (before
//! the per-source dispatchers). It owns [`IoEvent::AdvanceNativeQueue`] and the
//! transport controls for the queue slot's player, and it relinquishes the queue
//! slot when the user starts an unrelated playback.
//!
//! Compiled unconditionally; the decoded-playback bodies are gated per source
//! feature. In a slim build the engine reduces to "skip every item with a
//! `not available in this build` status" — correct, and enough for the pump to
