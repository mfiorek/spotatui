//! The DJ tool surface: one definition, two consumers.
//!
//! The MCP server (`mcp-server`) publishes these verbatim as MCP tools; the
//! in-TUI DJ (`ai-dj`) calls the same handlers directly. Keeping the list here
//! means an agent driving spotatui over MCP and the built-in DJ can never drift
//! apart in what they are able to do.
//!
//! Schemas are JSON Schema 2020-12, which is the MCP default dialect (a tool
//! taking no arguments uses `{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false}`, the
//! spec's recommended empty schema). The list order is fixed and deterministic:
//! MCP clients cache `tools/list`, and a stable order also improves prompt-cache
//! hit rates when the tools are rendered into model context.
