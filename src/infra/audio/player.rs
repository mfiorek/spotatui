//! Local-file audio playback engine.
//!
//! [`LocalPlayer`] decodes an audio file and plays it through the system's
//! default output device, independent of librespot. The decoded audio reaches
//! the same default device the visualizer's loopback/monitor captures, so the
//! spectrum visualizer works for local playback without any extra wiring.
//!
//! ## Encapsulation
//!
//! All `rodio` types are contained inside this module. The public surface is a
//! small transport API (`play_file`/`pause`/`resume`/`seek`/`position`/
//! `is_finished`/`set_volume`) that speaks `std` types only. This keeps the
//! runtime free of `rodio` and makes the platform-specific output swap below a
//! single-file change.
//!
//! ## Cross-platform output
//!
//! `rodio` drives the default output device on all three platforms, CoreAudio
//! included. macOS was gated off here until the rodio 0.22 / cpal 0.17 output
//! path was measured on a Mac (the two `#[ignore]`d tests below): the crashes
//! behind that gate (issues #9/#20) were librespot's own `rodio-backend`, an
//! older rodio on the pre-`DeviceSinkBuilder` API. librespot still uses
//! `portaudio-backend` on macOS for that reason; this player does not share
//! that code path and does not need it.
//!
//! ## Losing the output device
//!
//! Losing the device mid-track takes two shapes, and only one of them is an
//! error anybody reports. cpal notices the device being *removed* and reports
//! `DeviceNotAvailable`. It cannot notice the far more common case: the OS
//! moving its **default output** somewhere else — headphones unplugged, AirPods
//! back in their case — which leaves the stream happily bound to a device
//! nobody is listening to. So the sink also remembers which device it opened
//! and [`device_lost`](LocalPlayer::device_lost) compares that against the
//! current default.
//!
//! Either way no audio callback runs again, and that matters far beyond
//! silence: rodio's
//! `clear` and `try_seek` *wait on that callback* (`sleep_until_end`, and the
//! seek feedback channel, neither with a timeout), and the transport methods
//! here are called straight from the serial IoEvent pump. A blocked one wedges
//! the pump, and with it every unrelated thing behind it — searches included.
//!
//! So every method that would wait on the audio thread refuses once the device
//! is gone, and — because a detector that misses one day would freeze the app
//! again — the wait itself is bounded: an audio thread that does not answer
//! *is* the last-resort detector. The driver's tick notices, calls
//! [`LocalPlayer::reopen`] to rebuild the output on the new default device, and
//! restages the track there.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! `rodio::MixerDeviceSink` is `!Send`, so it cannot live on the shared player
//! struct (which is held behind an `Arc` across async tasks). Instead a
//! dedicated thread owns the `MixerDeviceSink` and keeps it alive; the player
//! holds only the `Send + Sync` [`rodio::Player`] plus a keepalive channel whose
//! drop tells the thread to release the device.
